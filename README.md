# UrTern Internship Project

This is a console application made in CSCE 247: Software Engineering on a tight schedule, so not all functionality was finished.  You can access the app as a student and edit your resume and browse/apply to internship posts, or you sign in as an employer and create internship posts and leave reviews on students. 

To run the project.  First, clone the repository by running the following command in the terminal:

git clone https://github.com/adamsteger/internship.git

Then run the main method in InternshipUI.java.
